# KYC Skip Implementation

## Overview
Implemented the ability for users to skip the KYC (Know Your Customer) verification process after signup, similar to how MFA can be skipped. This provides flexibility for users who want to start using the platform immediately while still encouraging proper verification.

## Backend Changes

### 1. User Model Updates (`backend/src/models/User.ts`)
Added new KYC-related fields to the User interface and schema:

```typescript
// Interface
kycRequired: boolean;
kycCompleted: boolean;
kycSkipped: boolean;

// Schema
kycRequired: {
  type: Boolean,
  default: true // KYC is required by default for marketers
},
kycCompleted: {
  type: Boolean,
  default: false
},
kycSkipped: {
  type: Boolean,
  default: false
}
```

### 2. Auth Controller Updates (`backend/src/controllers/auth.ts`)
- **Enhanced `getCurrentUser`**: Now returns KYC status fields
- **Added `skipKYC`**: New endpoint to allow marketers to skip KYC verification

```typescript
static async skipKYC(req: AuthenticatedRequest, res: Response) {
  // Only allows marketers to skip KYC
  // Updates kycSkipped: true, kycRequired: false
  // Logs the skip action for audit purposes
}
```

### 3. Auth Routes (`backend/src/routes/auth.ts`)
Added new route:
```typescript
router.post('/skip-kyc', authenticate, AuthController.skipKYC);
```

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Auth Slice Updates (`frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`)
Updated User interface to include KYC fields:
```typescript
export interface User {
  // ... existing fields
  kycRequired: boolean;
  kycCompleted: boolean;
  kycSkipped: boolean;
}
```

### 2. Auth Service (`frontend/src/services/authService.ts`)
Added skip KYC method:
```typescript
async skipKYC(): Promise<void> {
  return this.post<void>('/skip-kyc')
}
```

### 3. KYC Verification Page (`frontend/src/pages/KYCVerificationPage.tsx`)
Major enhancements:
- **Added intro step**: New initial step explaining KYC process
- **Skip functionality**: Users can skip KYC with a clear warning
- **Improved UX**: Better flow with skipable option
- **Progress indicator**: Only shows for actual KYC steps, not intro

Key features:
```typescript
const handleSkipKYC = async () => {
  await authService.skipKYC()
  toast('You can complete KYC verification later from your profile settings.')
  navigate('/dashboard')
}
```

### 4. MFA Setup Page (`frontend/src/pages/MFASetupPage.tsx`)
Updated navigation logic to check KYC status:
```typescript
const checkKYCStatusAndNavigate = async () => {
  if (user?.role === 'admin') {
    navigate('/admin')
  } else if (user?.kycRequired && !user.kycCompleted && !user.kycSkipped) {
    navigate('/kyc-verification', { state: { skipable: true } })
  } else {
    navigate('/dashboard')
  }
}
```

## User Flow

### New User Registration Flow
1. **Register** → Email verification
2. **Login** → MFA setup (skipable)
3. **KYC Verification** (skipable) → Dashboard

### KYC Skip Flow
1. User sees KYC intro page with explanation
2. User can choose "Start Identity Verification" or "Skip for Now"
3. If skipped:
   - Backend updates `kycSkipped: true, kycRequired: false`
   - User redirected to dashboard
   - Toast message explains they can complete KYC later

### KYC Complete Flow
1. User chooses to complete KYC
2. Goes through normal KYC steps (info → documents → review → complete)
3. Backend updates `kycCompleted: true` when approved

## Security Considerations

### 1. Role-Based Access
- Only **marketers** can skip KYC
- **Admins** don't need KYC (different access model)
- Proper role validation in backend

### 2. Audit Trail
- All KYC skip actions are logged
- User email and timestamp recorded
- Can track who skipped vs completed KYC

### 3. Feature Limitations
- Skipped KYC users may have limited access to certain features
- Can be enforced in middleware or individual endpoints
- Clear messaging about limitations

## API Endpoints

### Skip KYC
```
POST /api/auth/skip-kyc
Authorization: Bearer <token>

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "KYC verification skipped successfully",
  "data": {
    "kycRequired": false,
    "kycCompleted": false,
    "kycSkipped": true
  }
}
```

### Get User Info (Enhanced)
```
GET /api/auth/me
Authorization: Bearer <token>

Response includes:
{
  "data": {
    // ... existing fields
    "kycRequired": boolean,
    "kycCompleted": boolean,
    "kycSkipped": boolean
  }
}
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests (`backend/src/__tests__/kyc-skip.test.ts`)
Comprehensive test coverage:
- ✅ Marketer can skip KYC
- ✅ Admin cannot skip KYC
- ✅ Authentication required
- ✅ User info includes KYC fields
- ✅ Status updates correctly after skip

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **New marketer registration** → Should see skipable KYC
2. **Admin registration** → Should not see KYC step
3. **Skip KYC** → Should go to dashboard with toast message
4. **Complete KYC** → Should go through full verification flow

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
No new environment variables required. Uses existing authentication and database configuration.

### Feature Flags (Future)
Could add feature flags to control:
- `KYC_SKIP_ENABLED`: Enable/disable skip functionality
- `KYC_REQUIRED_ROLES`: Which roles require KYC
- `KYC_SKIP_LIMITATIONS`: What features are limited for skipped users

## Migration Considerations

### Existing Users
- Existing users will have default values:
  - `kycRequired: true`
  - `kycCompleted: false`
  - `kycSkipped: false`
- No migration script needed (defaults handle it)

### Database Impact
- Three new boolean fields per user
- Minimal storage impact
- Indexes may be beneficial for queries filtering by KYC status

## Future Enhancements

### 1. KYC Reminder System
- Periodic reminders for users who skipped KYC
- Email campaigns encouraging completion
- Dashboard notifications

### 2. Feature Limitations
- Implement feature gates based on KYC status
- Higher commission limits for verified users
- Premium features require KYC completion

### 3. Admin Dashboard
- View KYC completion rates
- Identify users who skipped KYC
- Send targeted communications

### 4. Progressive KYC
- Allow partial KYC completion
- Different verification levels
- Gradual feature unlocking

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track
- KYC completion rate vs skip rate
- Time to complete KYC after skip
- Feature usage by KYC status
- Conversion rates for skipped users

### Logging
- All KYC skip actions logged with user ID and timestamp
- Can be used for compliance reporting
- Helps identify patterns in user behavior

## Compliance Notes

### Regulatory Considerations
- Some jurisdictions may require KYC for financial services
- Skip functionality should be configurable per region
- Maintain audit trail for compliance reporting

### Risk Management
- Monitor users who skip KYC for suspicious activity
- Implement transaction limits for non-verified users
- Regular review of skip policies and procedures
