# Cloudinary Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated Cloudinary cloud storage for KYC document uploads in the Partner IQ platform, replacing local file storage with a scalable cloud solution.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Cloudinary Service (`src/services/cloudinary/index.ts`)
- **Singleton service class** for consistent configuration across the application
- **Multiple upload methods**: buffer upload, file upload, batch upload
- **Specialized KYC upload** with proper folder organization (`kyc/{customerId}/`)
- **File management**: delete, retrieve details, generate secure URLs
- **Error handling** and graceful fallbacks
- **Automatic optimizations**: quality and format optimization

### 2. Updated Customer Controller (`src/controllers/customer.ts`)
- **Modified multer configuration** to use memory storage instead of disk storage
- **Enhanced `uploadKYCDocuments`** function to use Cloudinary
- **Added new endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/customers/onboarding/:customerId/kyc-documents/:documentId`
  - `DELETE /api/customers/onboarding/:customerId/kyc-documents/:documentId`
- **Fixed TypeScript errors** related to document `_id` fields
- **Updated deprecated API usage** (replaced `req.connection` with `req.socket`)

### 3. Enhanced Customer Model (`src/models/Customer.ts`)
- **Added Cloudinary fields** to KYC document schema:
  - `publicId`: Cloudinary public ID for file management
  - `fileSize`: File size in bytes
  - `format`: File format (jpg, png, pdf, etc.)
  - `_id`: Added to TypeScript interface for subdocument IDs
- **Removed unused variables** to clean up code

### 4. Environment Configuration
- **Added Cloudinary environment variables** to `.env`:
  ```env
  CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
  CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
  CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
  ```

### 5. Migration Utility (`src/services/cloudinary/migration.ts`)
- **Automated migration script** to move existing local files to Cloudinary
- **Batch processing** with error handling and reporting
- **Rollback capabilities** for safe migration
- **CLI command**: `npm run migrate:cloudinary`

### 6. Testing and Documentation
- **Unit tests** for Cloudinary service functionality
- **Comprehensive README** with setup and usage instructions
- **Migration documentation** and troubleshooting guide

## Key Benefits

1. **Scalability**: No more local disk storage limitations
2. **Performance**: CDN delivery and automatic optimizations
3. **Security**: Secure HTTPS URLs and access controls
4. **Organization**: Structured folder hierarchy for easy management
5. **Reliability**: Cloud redundancy and backup
6. **Maintenance**: Reduced server storage management overhead

## File Organization

```
kyc/
├── {customerId1}/
│   ├── government_id_timestamp1.jpg
│   ├── proof_of_address_timestamp2.pdf
│   └── ...
├── {customerId2}/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## API Changes

### New Endpoints
- **Get Document**: `GET /api/customers/onboarding/:customerId/kyc-documents/:documentId`
- **Delete Document**: `DELETE /api/customers/onboarding/:customerId/kyc-documents/:documentId`

### Enhanced Responses
KYC document objects now include:
```json
{
  "type": "government_id",
  "fileName": "passport.jpg",
  "fileUrl": "https://res.cloudinary.com/...",
  "publicId": "kyc/customer123/government_id_1234567890",
  "fileSize": 2048576,
  "format": "jpg",
  "uploadedAt": "2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create Cloudinary Account**
   - Sign up at https://cloudinary.com
   - Get credentials from dashboard

2. **Configure Environment**
   - Update `.env` with Cloudinary credentials
   - Restart the application

3. **Test Integration**
   - Upload a KYC document through the API
   - Verify file appears in Cloudinary dashboard

4. **Migrate Existing Files** (if needed)
   ```bash
   npm run migrate:cloudinary
   ```

## Error Handling

The integration includes comprehensive error handling:
- **Configuration validation**: Checks if Cloudinary is properly configured
- **Upload failures**: Graceful error responses with retry suggestions
- **Network issues**: Fallback to stored URLs when Cloudinary is unavailable
- **File not found**: Proper 404 responses for missing documents

## Security Considerations

- All uploads use secure HTTPS URLs
- Files are organized in customer-specific folders
- Public IDs are used for secure file management
- Automatic quality optimization reduces file sizes
- Access controls can be implemented at the Cloudinary level

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- Monitor Cloudinary usage through their dashboard
- Set up usage alerts to avoid overage charges
- Regular cleanup of unused files can be automated
- Consider implementing file retention policies

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the future:
1. **Image transformations**: Automatic resizing and format conversion
2. **Advanced security**: Signed URLs with expiration times
3. **Backup strategy**: Automated backups to secondary storage
4. **Analytics**: File access and usage analytics
5. **Compression**: Advanced compression for document files
